# E-commerce product rating system based on Senti-lexicon Analysis

In e-commerce websites, customers usually make comments, which include the properties of the product, the attitude towards the vendor, express delivery information after
buying the products. The information provides an important reference when others
buy products in the website. In sentiment analysis, a finer-grained opinion mining
approach focuses on not only the product itself as a whole but also product features,
which can be a part or attribute of the product. Previous related research focus on
various fields like movie rating and research purpose. Whereas, our approach is to take
the comments from the review section which is implied by some words or phrases, are
very significant and meaningful to express users opinion. In this thesis, we propose
a new approach to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews using lexicon based approach i.e senti-lexicon approach. Our experimental results prove the effectiveness of
the approach.
